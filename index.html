                            <h3>Why I Am Interested in Business Analytics</h3>

                            <p><b>My interest in business analytics started during my undergraduate studies when I was assigned a project to analyze social media data.

The moment I presented my findings, showing how data could uncover hidden patterns and influence strategies, I knew I had found my passion. This experience ignited my enthusiasm for analytics and demonstrated the profound impact of data-driven decisions.</b></p>
                            <p><b>Further into my MBA program, I conducted a study on AI's impact on e-commerce businesses, which deepened my understanding of analytics' transformative power. This project solidified my commitment to helping organizations harness data's potential. Business analytics perfectly combines my love for numbers and problem-solving, allowing me to drive strategic decisions and improve business performance. I am eager to continue my journey in this field and contribute to the success of forward-thinking companies.</b></p>
